		<h2> Website Purpose </h2>
		<p>  There is only so much you can fit on your resume and there are countless of important things that get left off. Some would call this site an extension of my resume one meant to be more than a page long summary of myself. I created this website to provide any necessary information needed by my colleagues and coworkers alike. This is in some ways a directory meant to push you in the right direction when searching for anything related to me.</p>
		<h2> Who Am I? </h2>
		<p>  I am a computer science student looking to get his hands dirty with the latest technology.  Right now I am currently in the process of searching for an internship for this upcoming summer. To learn more about my technical skills you can refer to my resume.</p>
		<h2> What Can I Find On This Site? </h2>
		<p>  Specifically on this site you can find my contact information in case you would like to get in touch. Provided are my email, phone number, and Linked In. Provided is a link to my GitHub if you would like to see any code I have shared publicly.</p>
